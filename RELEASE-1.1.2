The 1.1.2 release primarily addresses four issues:

1.  Subscribing to an empty set caused replication to break with
a malformed query on the subscriber. 

2.  During the execution of DDL scripts, all tables will be restored
in order to support cross-schema DDL.

3.  UPDATE FUNCTIONS got fixed to support upgrading from 1.0.6.

4.  In the case of failover we need the same ACCEPT_SET guarding, so
that the remaining subscribers do not process any events from the
backup node before they have finished all remaining events from the
failed node, that might be queued up on the backup.

ACCEPT_SET must also restart slon in order to guarantee that the new
configuration is loaded.
