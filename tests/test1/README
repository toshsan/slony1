  
test1 is a basic test that replication generally functions.  
  
It creates three simple tables as one replication set, and replicates
them from one database to another.
  
The three tables are of the three interesting types:
  
1.  table1 has a formal primary key

2.  table2 lacks a formal primary key, but has a candidate primary key

3.  table3 has no candidate primary key; Slony-I is expected to
    generate one on its own.

It actually tries replicating a fourth table, which has an invalid
candidate primary key (columns not defined NOT NULL), which should
cause it to be rejected.  That is done in a slonik TRY {} block.

It also creates...

5.  table5 which has columns of all sorts of vaguely esoteric types to
exercise that points, paths, bitmaps, mac addresses, and inet types
replicate properly.

6.  It does a test of the function generate_sync_event() to make sure
that it works as expected

7.  It does a test of make_function_strict(), a function used in
'UPDATE FUNCTIONS' to change the xxidin() function to be STRICT.
