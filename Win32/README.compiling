I created new makefiles for slony_funcs and xxid using the contrib
infrastructure, which makes them win32 compatible. IMHO the attached
versions should replace the current ones.

After some short tests, Slony-I 1.0.5 seems to be able to replicate
with win32 servers using those modules correctly.

The slon process currently refuses to link, the thread lib seems to be
the problem.

Apparently slonik uses fork(), which would make porting it much more
expensive. I won't spent more time on that, pgAdmin will do that
anyway.
